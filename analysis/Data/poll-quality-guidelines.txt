By default a standard poll is represented by an effective sample size of 1000 (pending evidence that larger sample sizes produce a more reliable result in practice as well as in theory).

This is then adjusted according to the following "strikes" - factors that indicate a poll may be less reliable than others:
 - After the inception of the Australian Polling Council (1 Jun 2021), not a member
 - Poll is commissioned by a non-media organisation
 - Poll is not officially published, but unofficially released (note: leaked party internal polls are banned entirely)
 - Poll is not part of a regular, fully published series (polls in the 2 weeks before an election are exempt)
 - Poll has sample size less than 1000 (assumed if no sample size given)
 - Poll has sample size less than 600
 - Poll has sample size less than 400
 - First five region-wide polls published by the pollster under this methodology
 - In addition, first two region-wide polls published by the pollster under this methodology
 - Poll has never been tested at an election
 - Poll has history of being biased/inaccurate across previous elections (2 strikes - applies mainly to Morgan F2F)
 
These last two requirements ensure that new polls and methodologies do not overly skew averages until such a time as they have been established long enough for the pollster to work out the kinks.

Internally, the poll is then adjusted according to the number of strikes, with each reducing the effective sample size by 40%.
Put together, depending on the quality of the polls, the poll quality may assume the following values:
 - 1 strike:	0.6
 - 2 strikes:	0.36
 - 3 strikes:	0.216
 - 4 strikes:	0.13
 - 5 strikes: 	0.078
 - 6 strikes:	0.047
 
For simplicity we round to the first three decimal places even though this is not quite precise, as the quality adjustment is already somewhat arbitrary in the first place
