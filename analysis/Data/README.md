Warning: if you open csv files in Excel it will convert the date entries to whatever the default local format is. However to avoid ambiguties between US and AU formats they need to be in the yyyy-mm-dd format. Therefore in order to maintain the correct date format, either:
* Open in a text editor such as Notepad++, which will not change the format, or
* Change the default date format on your system to yyyy-mm-dd following the instructions [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel/changing-default-date-format-for-csv-download/m-p/1642250), or
* After editing cells in Excel, manually select the dates and adjust them to the correct format
