Polling Analyser to-do:
-Add feature for taking snapshots of simulation result summaries
 -First, add region and seats-specific data to the report instead of holding them in the basic elements, make sure this works
 -(DisplayFrameRenderer should not be depending on PollingProject at this point)
 -Load/save for the latest report for each simulation
 -Create and load/save snapshots for each simulation

-At some point update WA-2021/fed-2022 model parameters to include qld-2020
