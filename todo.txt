 -Rework pollster analysis to strictly exclude future polls and generate separate data for any given date/election combination. (Will create a lot of files, but should be small individually)
 -Ensure poll trend generation can deal with missing GRN and/or OTH votes (probably just drop polls that don't specify OTH, and treat GRN same as other minor parties)
 -Run all poll trends that have enough previous pollster data (assess how much after completing previous points)
 -(Wait for above to complete)
 -Rework trend adjust to strictly avoid using future elections and re-run for all elections past a certain date (this creates the baseline for comparison with the next step)
 -Overhaul trend adjust to use bayesian aggregation to determine best bias adjustment for each party type
 -

 -General refactor of frontend as there is currently a lot of code duplication
 -Develop mechanism for making hindcasts and assigning an appropriate date for when they "would" have been done
 -Check that all parts of the system sufficiently exclude an election from impacting its own forecast (for hindcasts)
 -Overhaul mechanisms to count WA Nats as a separate party while maintaining TPP dynamics
 -Create hindcasts for earlier parts of 2022fed and maybe 2022sa
 -Create hindcasts for earlier elections
