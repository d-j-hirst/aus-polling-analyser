Polling Analyser to-do:
-Methodological adjustments
 -Adjust IND -> major preference flow based on historical regression with margin size and IND primary,
  this should help with INDs being underrated in more heavily conservative seats
 -Check that above calculation is included in both calculation of preference bias and the subsequent calculation of major party vote
-Add data display step by step to the webpage (* indicates not release-critical):
 -Party vote totals
  *Stacked area graph of distribution across time for individual parties
 -Individual seats
  *cartogram, maybe map view depending on feasibility
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
 -FAQs
  -What's the point?
  -What if you're wrong?
  -What about this hypothetical event?
  -What's the difference between the regular forecast and the now-cast?
  -What does it really mean for there to be an X% chance of winning an election/seat?
  -Why don't the vote totals add to 100%? Why don't the seat totals add to the number of seats in Parliament?

-Post-release, as soon as possible before election is called:
 -Integrate confirmed candidacies (for 3rd parties)
 -Integrate betting odds
 -Further investigation for seat-by-seat differences in TPP behaviour

-Before election day, if possible:
 -Advanced simulations!
  -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
