-Post-election to-do:
 -Release forecast officially here!
 -Indicators on front-end for factors involved in a seat's TPP (and maybe other components)
 *** SHOULD REACH HERE BY THE START OF VICTORIAN CAMPAIGN ***
 -Condense past elections to dropdown menu
 -Live forecasts:
  -Investigate methods for getting live VIC booth data
  -Overall fp vote estimates narrowed much too quickly last time, investigate
  -Better estimate of major party fp votes
  -More accurate distribution of preferences (OTH -> GRN (vs. LIB) perhaps too low in Ryan?)
  -Investigate very high GRN chances in Macnamara/Richmond on election night
  -More info about e.g. % counted, actual results (if time permits)
 *** SHOULD REACH HERE BY VIC ELECTION NIGHT ***
 -
 -Further post with analysis of election forecast & also SA (or maybe leave this until after NSW?)
 -Develop systems for handling OPV preference flows in NSW
 -Overhaul mechanisms to account for exhaustion under OPV
 -Prepare NSW forecast
 *** SHOULD REACH HERE BY THE START OF NSW CAMPAIGN ***
 -General refactor of frontend as there is currently a lot of code duplication
 -Develop mechanism for making hindcasts and assigning an appropriate date for when they "would" have been done
 -Check that all parts of the system sufficiently exclude an election from impacting its own forecast (for hindcasts)
 -Overhaul mechanisms to count WA Nats as a separate party while maintaining TPP dynamics
 -Create hindcasts for earlier parts of 2022fed and maybe 2022sa
 -Create hindcasts for earlier elections
