 -FAQs
  -What's the point?
  -What if you're wrong?
  -What about this hypothetical event?
  -What's the difference between the regular forecast and the now-cast?
  -What does it really mean for there to be an X% chance of winning an election/seat?
  -Why don't the vote totals add to 100%? Why don't the seat totals add to the number of seats in Parliament?
  -How should I interpret the different two-party-preferred scenarios?


-Before election day, if possible:
 -Advanced simulations!
  -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
