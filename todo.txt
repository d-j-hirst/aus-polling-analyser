-live simulations
 -adjust for redistributions/new booths not being usable for swings
  -while ordinary vote is only partially counted, use swings directly as already implemented
  -once ordinary vote is fully counted, declaration vote can be assumed to follow same patterns as last time overall w/ uncertainty
  -from 80% to 100% (estimated) of ordinary (incl. ppvc) votes counted, transition between the two
  -for fully counted ordinary vote, calculate implied swing of dec vote (i.e. last election total tpp - ordinary tpp), estimate final ordinary swing based on that, and then work backward
  
 -estimate non-tpp swings by comparing to previous tpp results with offset
 -project onto uncounted booths via regression to improve seat estimate & uncertainty
 -project existing results to uncounted seats to improve estimates for other seats

-Advanced live simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
 -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
 -Then organise the existing election data
