-Post-election to-do:
 -Publish final result comparisons with forecasts
 -Post on website & twitter regarding above
 -Further post with analysis of election forecast & also SA
 -Fix Calare others issue (forecasts predicts others vote despite being entered with no valid OTH candidates)
 -Look at Melton (very high others vote, even after accounting for a high vote there last time too)
 -General refactor of frontend as there is currently a lot of code duplication
 -More rigorous process for handling multiple independents
 -Live forecasts:
  -Overall fp vote estimates narrowed much too quickly last time, investigate
  -Better estimate of major party fp votes
  -More accurate distribution of preferences (OTH -> GRN (vs. LIB) perhaps too low in Ryan?)
  -Investigate very high GRN chances in Macnamara/Richmond on election night
 -Develop mechanism for making hindcasts and assigning an appropriate date for when they "would" have been done
 -Check that all parts of the system sufficiently exclude an election from impacting its own forecast (for hindcasts)
 -Overhaul mechanisms to count WA Nats as a separate party while maintaining TPP dynamics
 -Overhaul mechanisms to account for exhaustion under OPV
 -Prepare NSW forecast
 -Create hindcasts for earlier parts of 2022fed and maybe 2022sa
 -Create hindcasts for earlier elections
