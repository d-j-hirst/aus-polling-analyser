Polling Analyser to-do:
-Footer?
 -Legal stuff
 -Somewhere acknowledge used code/modules (e.g. unzip, json, scikit-learn)

Immediately before release:
 -set default page to default forecast page (rather than clouds page)
 -Make polling analyser repo public
 -Remove login protections

-Soon after release:
 -glossary
 -Script to auto-check seat betting odds.
 -Restructure About page so it's not all in the same component?
 *options to sort in various ways by % chance, alphabetical, state, margin
 -caching most recently loaded forecast
 -Graph for prediction over time - for overall forecast and then maybe individual seats
 -cartogram, maybe map view depending on feasibility
 -Individual seats winner bar for 2cp scenarios (maybe?)
 -Anything non-critical above not done before release.
-Before SA election day, if possible:
-Before federal election day, if possible:
 -Advanced live simulations!
  -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election data
