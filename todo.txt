Polling Analyser to-do:
-Take historical polling analysis from its current cumbersome spreadsheet to a fast, automatic program
 -Adjust errors and mix-factors to be monotonic
 -Refactor to separate into smaller methods, use data classes and remove code no longer used
-Small item: Put some hard-coded things like number of threads to use into a config file
-More sophisticated handling of non-classic and potentially non-classic seats
-Better treatment of state-based TPP swings, especially for small states which are currently fairly arbitrary
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage

-Configure model # of simulations by user
-Advanced simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
