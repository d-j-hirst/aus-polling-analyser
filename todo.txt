Polling Analyser to-do:
-Custom known preference flows for non-classic 2cps
-Fix emerging ind median value
-Output additional scenario types:
 -Each major party win more seats than the other but without assumed support for minority
 -Major parties exactly tied
 -Some other party has the most seats
-Output per-seat primary vote as part of snapshots (and include in display?)
-Output separate TCPs for each simulated set of 2cp candidates
-Better treatment of state-based TPP swings, especially for small states which are currently fairly arbitrary
-Also check distribution of seat TPP swings
-Tidy up code from this part of the project
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
- *** ANALYSIS PHASE COMPLETE ***
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage
-Post-release, as soon as possible before election is called:
 -Integrate confirmed candidacies (for 3rd parties)
 -Integrate betting odds
 -Further investigation for seat-by-seat differences in TPP behaviour

-Before election day, if possible:
 -Advanced simulations!
  -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
