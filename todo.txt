-Finish bits of NSW forecast not yet complete.
 -Kiama stuff (IND interference under OPV).
 -Add new sections to forecast guide for by-election swings and Kiama stuff.
 -Prepare seat betting code. Do a number of test simulation runs to calibrate the odds and use that for the actual election.
 -Maybe write an update post?
-Fed 
 -Add all remaining fed (and maybe state) approval ratings. Check Essential Report dates for each year.
 -Create weighted regressions to convert approval ratings -> TPPs.
 -Use this to create synthetic TPP series
 -During creation of past TPP trends, further create synthetic major party FPs according to the minor party FPs and synthetic TPPs.
 -Use these to extend pollster analysis for synthetic TPPs.
 -Reorganise poll trend generation to put minor party FPs first ...
 -So that we can generate provisional synthetic FPs for major parties
 -Use the synthetic FPs and TPPs in their respective poll trend generators.
 -Get everything else in the forecast ready
 -Write release post
 -Publish

 -General refactor of frontend as there is currently a lot of code duplication
 -Develop mechanism for making hindcasts and assigning an appropriate date for when they "would" have been done
 -Check that all parts of the system sufficiently exclude an election from impacting its own forecast (for hindcasts)
 -Overhaul mechanisms to count WA Nats as a separate party while maintaining TPP dynamics
 -Create hindcasts for earlier parts of 2022fed and maybe 2022sa
 -Create hindcasts for earlier elections
