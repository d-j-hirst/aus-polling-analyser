For Nationals:
 -Check L-NC majority/minority position (seems low ATM)
 -Do something to remove/cut off aberrant forecasts in history
 -Investigate seats where ON gets no vote >50% of the time
 -Handle correlations between seats in NAT vote share
 -Some more code to more precisely handle whether NAT/LIB will run in a seat

 -Rework pollster analysis to strictly exclude future polls and generate separate data for any given date/election combination. (Will create a lot of files, but should be small individually)
 -Setup 6-monthly calibration updates for in-progress polls and set pollster analyses to use these where possible
 -Run all poll trends that have enough previous pollster data (assess how much after completing previous points)
 -(Wait for above to complete)
 -Rework trend adjust to strictly avoid using future elections and re-run for all elections past a certain date (this creates the baseline for comparison with the next step)
 -Overhaul trend adjust to use bayesian aggregation to determine best bias adjustment for each party type

 -General refactor of frontend as there is currently a lot of code duplication
 -Develop mechanism for making hindcasts and assigning an appropriate date for when they "would" have been done
 -Check that all parts of the system sufficiently exclude an election from impacting its own forecast (for hindcasts)
 -Overhaul mechanisms to count WA Nats as a separate party while maintaining TPP dynamics
 -Create hindcasts for earlier parts of 2022fed and maybe 2022sa
 -Create hindcasts for earlier elections
 
Workflow:
 -run trend models with --bias, --calibrate
 -run pollster analyses (must wait for all trend models with overlapping time to do --bias and --calibrate)
 -run "pure" analyses (pollster analysis for this election (only) must be complete)
 -run full analyses (pure analysis for all previous and overlapping times must be complete)
 -run analyses w/cutoffs (can be done as soon as previous/overlapping pure trends are done)
 -run trend adjustment (need cutoffs up to and including this election to be complete)
