-live simulations
 -seatwide swing
 -conversions between program and AEC party codes
 -basic integration with existing forecast as for live-manual
 -confirm ability to upload forecast accordingly (locally/to test site)
 -account for possible systemic differences between different voting types and booth types including PPVCs
 -live-estimate changes in voting patterns (ordinary vs. ppvc, etc.) 
 -fp to tcp conversion for booths not reporting tcp (if deemed necessary) incl. calculation of estimated preference flows nationally and per seat via regression
 -publish new (unmatched) raw tcp estimates
 -fp swings for parties (after logit transform)
 -publish estimated fp results
 -estimate non-tpp swings by comparing to previous tpp results with offset
 -project onto uncounted booths via regression to improve seat estimate & uncertainty
 -project existing results to uncounted seats to improve estimates for other seats
 -projections for fp as well as tcp votes

-Advanced live simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
 -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
 -Then organise the existing election data
