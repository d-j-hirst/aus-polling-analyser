-Post-election to-do:
 -When bias-correction trend modelling is complete, design system for estimating house effect weighting
  -House effects sum to zero => weighted house effects sum to zero
  -Weighting is based on:
   -(a) how small house effect is compared to average of all pollsters (without considering results)
   -(b) if final poll (last 2 weeks) is closer to result than poll trend, then
        upweight IF house effect adjusted poll is close to poll trend.
		(this last bit prevents rewarding lucky poll/herding, you only get a bonus for hitting the right result
		if your polls have usually been on the "correct" side of the trend throughout)
  -Might want to repeat the process a few times until it converges
 -Retired incumbent INDs (i.e. Graeme Northe) never recontest
 -Previously unsuccessful recontesting INDs should be included among emerging INDs (unless confirmed)
 -Fix Calare others issue (forecasts predicts others vote despite being entered with no valid OTH candidates)
 -Candidate names incl. independents
  -Add ability to enter and same candidate names
  -include in forecast report
  -display names on frontend
  -remove the "Emerging Independent" designation on frontend
  -remove "Emerging IND" sorting options
 -More rigorous process for handling multiple independents
 -Release forecast officially here!
 -Indicators on front-end for factors involved in a seat's TPP (and maybe other components)
 *** SHOULD REACH HERE BY THE START OF VICTORIAN CAMPAIGN ***
 -General refactor of frontend as there is currently a lot of code duplication
 -Live forecasts:
  -Investigate methods for getting live VIC booth data
  -Overall fp vote estimates narrowed much too quickly last time, investigate
  -Better estimate of major party fp votes
  -More accurate distribution of preferences (OTH -> GRN (vs. LIB) perhaps too low in Ryan?)
  -Investigate very high GRN chances in Macnamara/Richmond on election night
  -More info about e.g. % counted, actual results (if time permits)
 *** SHOULD REACH HERE BY VIC ELECTION NIGHT ***
 -Further post with analysis of election forecast & also SA
 -Develop systems for handling OPV preference flows in NSW
 -Develop mechanism for making hindcasts and assigning an appropriate date for when they "would" have been done
 -Check that all parts of the system sufficiently exclude an election from impacting its own forecast (for hindcasts)
 -Overhaul mechanisms to account for exhaustion under OPV
 -Prepare NSW forecast
 -Overhaul mechanisms to count WA Nats as a separate party while maintaining TPP dynamics
 -Create hindcasts for earlier parts of 2022fed and maybe 2022sa
 -Create hindcasts for earlier elections
