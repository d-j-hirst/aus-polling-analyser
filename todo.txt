Polling Analyser to-do:
-More sophisticated handling of non-classic and potentially non-classic seats
 -region/seat fp reconciliation
 -calculation of eventual winner from fp results
  -re-adjust to add to 100%
  -calculate a result using preference distributions w/ some assumptions for unknowns
   -we already have something like this	-exit out early if a classic 2pp is guaranteed to avoid unnecessary calculations
 -Keep track of simulated recontest-only stats for independents and minors that may not recontest
 -Output per-seat primary vote as part of snapshots (and include in display?)
 -Tidy up code from this part of the project
-Better treatment of state-based TPP swings, especially for small states which are currently fairly arbitrary
 -Also check distribution of seat TPP swings
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage
-Post-release, as soon as possible before election is called:
 -Integrate confirmed candidacies (for 3rd parties)
 -Integrate betting odds
 -Further investigation for seat-by-seat differences in TPP behaviour

-Before election day, if possible:
 -Advanced simulations!
  -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
