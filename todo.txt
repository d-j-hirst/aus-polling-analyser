Polling Analyser to-do:
-Add model parameters for projection, since the model now has to do "in-house projection" to estimate the present state anyway
 -Two parameters for poll de-biasing (1a, 1b): intercept and slope (for fit of poll bias vs. log-days)
 -Three parameters for poll history mixing (2a, 2b, 2c): maximum poll weight, log-days for zero poll weight ("poll information horizon"), hyperbola sharpness
 -Two parameters for poll standard deviation adjustment (3a, 3b): gradient and intercept
 -Historical value (4): some average of historical election results to combine the poll result with
-Create algorithm for generating an adjusted sample from a raw sample given a certain number of days, as follows:
 -Convert number of days to log-days
 -Transform raw poll number
 -De-bias poll average estimate according to (1a, 1b) by calculating the trend estimate of the bias and then subtracting that from the raw value
 -Mix this debiased poll average with historical value using (2a, 2b, 2c) according to the formula found in the Excel sheet.
 -For adjusting for variation in systemic bias, some more calculations are required:
  -Approximate sampling error as normal with SD of "a", and systemic error as normal with SD of "y"
  -Then combined standard deviation "c" is given by c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
  -Then assume effective sample size of 3000 for final election polls. This gives a standard deviation of 0.008333 for "a" (via 0.25/sqrt(samplesize), adjust later)
  -We also know the combined standard deviation "c", given by the line defined by parameters (3a, 3b) (gradient-transform this before use)
  -So by rearranging the formula above, we end up with a = sqrt(c^2 - b^2) (All standard deviations are by definition positive)
  -Then add systemic error to the mixed poll average with mean 0 and standard deviation a.
 -Untransform values
 -Normalise so that all sampled values add to 100
-Observations of these samples for the minimum number of days (2) are used to create the adjusted sample spread.
 -Note that this is not subsequently used in calculations
-Similarly, observations of these samples with varying numbers of days are used to create the forward projection.
-Finally, observations of these samples are used to create the range of scenarios for the simulation (rather than being taken from the projection as was formerly the case)
