Polling Analyser to-do:
-Party support adjustments
 -Option to display in trend visualiser
 -Function to sample the state of a given time point (normalised so all parties hit 100%), and test how well those samples match the adjusted values
-TPP estimates
 -Ability to enter estimates for expected preference flow + variability in edit model dialog
 -Have this be used to create a TPP estimate display series (for visual display only; the simulated value will be done separately)
-Projections
 -Overhaul to take a sample from the last day of the adjusted party support then project that to election in similar manner to before (i.e. random walk with some mean reversion)
 -Method to take a sample from a given time point in the projection
-Simulation
 -Take samples from the end of the projection and then generate random variability in preferences that align with the ancestral StanModel settings for each iteration.
  This can then be directly integrated into the simulations which will otherwise run as before for non-live or live-manual simulations
