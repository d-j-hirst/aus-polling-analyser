Polling Analyser to-do:
-More sophisticated handling of non-classic and potentially non-classic seats
 -finish rework of simulations
  -make # of threads configurable (as for models/projections)
  -get all the other data out of the seats
  -add % win for every seat for all parties (at least for those that get a win)
  -update save file to store all the new data we're taking
 -complete Greens analysis and include in simulation model as proof-of-concept
  -smooth Greens distribution parameters (except sophomore coefficient)
  -output Greens distribution to file
  -output previous election primary vote and 2cp figures to csv file
  -Get main program to internalise past primary votes from above csv file
  -Work Greens distributions into simulations, similarly to the way currently done for live simulations
   -sample primary votes for each party based on distributions where available for minors/independents
   -while we don't have a distribution for it, assume others-collectively remains identical to previous election, keeping 20%+ primary independents separate
   -directly adjust major party primary votes based on overall TPP swings
   -re-adjust to add to 100%
   -calculate a result using preference distributions w/ some assumptions for unknowns
    -we already have something like this
	-exit out early if a classic 2pp is guaranteed to avoid unnecessary calculations
   -re-adjust ALP/LNP primaries to give the correct TPP?
   -Output per-seat primary vote as part of snapshots
  -Do similar process for independent votes
   -Analyse when new significant independent candidates arise. How often do they achieve certain primary votes, are there patterns in terms of type of seats or independent support in other elections
   -Analyse existing independent vote - separate out retirements from other vote changes, and measure both
   -Incorporate into main program similarly to how was done for Greens
  -Look at generic-others, and maybe populist parties
   -generic-others can be treated similarly to greens vote, we have to calculate it for each seat and ignore seats where no such candidates existed.
   -Populist parties can also be treated similarly, but may need some tweaks to handle rapid declines in region wide votes and first-election levels
    -Populist parties may be better served by comparing to long-term populism popularity in the seat/subregion rather than just previous election
   -Incorporate at least the generic-others and maybe populist parties into main program simulations
-Better treatment of state-based TPP swings, especially for small states which are currently fairly arbitrary
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage

-Advanced simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
