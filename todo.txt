Polling Analyser to-do:
-More sophisticated handling of non-classic and potentially non-classic seats
 -complete Greens analysis and include in simulation model as proof-of-concept
  -handle generic-others vote
  -recontest rates for independents
  -output preference flow from model samples
  -region/seat fp total matching
  -calculation of eventual winner from 
   -re-adjust to add to 100%
   -calculate a result using preference distributions w/ some assumptions for unknowns
    -we already have something like this
	-exit out early if a classic 2pp is guaranteed to avoid unnecessary calculations
   -Output per-seat primary vote as part of snapshots
-Better treatment of state-based TPP swings, especially for small states which are currently fairly arbitrary
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage

-Advanced simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
