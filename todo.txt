-live simulations
 -account for possible systemic differences between different voting types and booth types including PPVCs
 -live-estimate changes in voting patterns (ordinary vs. ppvc, etc.)
 -estimate non-tpp swings by comparing to previous tpp results with offset
 -project onto uncounted booths via regression to improve seat estimate & uncertainty
 -project existing results to uncounted seats to improve estimates for other seats
