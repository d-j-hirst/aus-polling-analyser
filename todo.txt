Polling Analyser to-do:
-Change simulation python script so it uses the previous election result as a data point
-Ability to enter poll quality (and update for historical values)
-Make python setup for pystan as streamlined as possible (i.e. not requiring more installation/setup than necessary)
-Take historical polling analysis from its current cumbersome spreadsheet to a fast, automatic program
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage

-Configure model # of simulations by user
-Advanced simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
