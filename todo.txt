-Complete "TPP-first" alternative methodology for determining primary votes
-Account for correlated error in emerging-ind performance
-Add data display step by step to the webpage (* indicates not release-critical):
 -Party vote totals
  *Stacked area graph of distribution across time for individual parties
 -Seat totals
  *Bar graph of seat count distribution for all individual parties
 -Individual seats
  -List view
  *cartogram, maybe map view depending on feasibility
  -List view:
   -Show chance of winning for each candidate/party
   -Dropdown for:
	-Show margin of victory distribution (horizonal shaded bars) across the most common TCP pairing
	-Primary distributions
	-Click through for full details including different TCP pairings
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
 -FAQs
  -What's the point?
  -What if you're wrong?
  -What about this hypothetical event?
  -What's the difference between the regular forecast and the now-cast?
  -What does it really mean for there to be an X% chance of winning an election/seat?
  -Why don't the vote totals add to 100%? Why don't the seat totals add to the number of seats in Parliament?

-Post-release, as soon as possible before election is called:
 -Integrate confirmed candidacies (for 3rd parties)
 -Integrate betting odds
 -Further investigation for seat-by-seat differences in TPP behaviour

-Before election day, if possible:
 -Advanced simulations!
  -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
