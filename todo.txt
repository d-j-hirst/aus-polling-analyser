-live simulations
 -account for possible systemic differences between different voting types and booth types including PPVCs
  -Have some estimate of ppvc bias + confidence/variation, randomly assign between simulations
  -Determine PPVC sensitivity for each seat
   -Expected PPVC votes = previous election PPVCs times some constant factor
						  OR actual recorded pre-poll vote rate (maybe add later)
						  +/- random factor, maybe
   -Subtract number of votes remaining
   -Possibly push result around a bit so that remaining pre-polls grow at similar rate to existing pre-polls
 -live-estimate changes in voting patterns (ordinary vs. ppvc, etc.)
 -estimate non-tpp swings by comparing to previous tpp results with offset
 -project onto uncounted booths via regression to improve seat estimate & uncertainty
 -project existing results to uncounted seats to improve estimates for other seats

-Advanced live simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
 -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
 -Then organise the existing election data
