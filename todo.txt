Polling Analyser to-do:
-More sophisticated handling of non-classic and potentially non-classic seats
 -Independents should be considered more likely to recontest as the next election approaches
  -Because some upcoming retirements occur mid-term and e.g. deaths in office are less likely as time passes
  -Requires passing days-until-election as part of the polling sample
 -Update seats list to order in ascending order of win% for most likely candidate and list higher third party chances
 -Variable days-to-election from betting odds
 -Keep track of simulated recontest-only stats for independents and minors that may not recontest
 -Output per-seat primary vote as part of snapshots (and include in display?)
 -Tidy up code from this part of the project
-Better treatment of state-based TPP swings, especially for small states which are currently fairly arbitrary
 -Also check distribution of seat TPP swings
-Investigate different recontest rates for incumbent independents
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
- *** ANALYSIS PHASE COMPLETE ***
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage
-Post-release, as soon as possible before election is called:
 -Integrate confirmed candidacies (for 3rd parties)
 -Integrate betting odds
 -Further investigation for seat-by-seat differences in TPP behaviour

-Before election day, if possible:
 -Advanced simulations!
  -Start by organising past election data at booth-level
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
