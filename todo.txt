 -Determine specific deviations - at each level, model observed deviation, subtract specific deviation from higher level and with the remainder lessen it according to confidence level.
 -Model preference flow deviations via aggregation + specific deviation in same manner as for tpp deviations
 -deviations can be injected into the mean expectation for election/region/seat by simply adding it to the (transformed) values
 -variance is a little more tricky, but can be approximated for now with a sliding linear scale (never exceeding pre-election variance)
  -could use a mix between historically observed variance with complete correlation and historically observed variance with no correlation, with mix factor and "historical observations" just guesstimates for a first pass.
 -secondary categories (vote type, urban/rural status, maybe booth size) can then be identified based on patterns in specific deviations. This can be done at whole-election level for a simpler implementation.
 -create projected deviation for each booth based on specific deviation +  the difference expected for each secondary category.
 -Project mean actual numerical results rather than percentages (to deal with Simpson's Paradox effects and take into account new booths) - require some adjustments to expectations for each category so they still add to the correct total
 -Will then need to aggregate these updates and use the new projected deviations in the simulations (rather than specific deviations).
 -Inclusion of known stats for prepoll/postal votes and adjustments between categories
 -Weight confidence heavily based on diversity (downweight similar inputs, upweight diverse inputs, truly high confidence requires all significant categories to be well covered)
 -Actually determine best parameters for variance
 -Modelling of formal vote % of electorate (somehow)
 -change weighting based on booths' prior indicativeness and status (e.g. booths that have changed seats in a redistribution should be downweighted and/or specially categorised)
 -whatever else

 -Rework pollster analysis to strictly exclude future polls and generate separate data for any given date/election combination. (Will create a lot of files, but should be small individually)
 -Setup 6-monthly calibration updates for in-progress polls and set pollster analyses to use these where possible
 -Run all poll trends that have enough previous pollster data (assess how much after completing previous points)
 -(Wait for above to complete)
 -Rework trend adjust to strictly avoid using future elections and re-run for all elections past a certain date (this creates the baseline for comparison with the next step)
 -Overhaul trend adjust to use bayesian aggregation to determine best bias adjustment for each party type

 -General refactor of frontend as there is currently a lot of code duplication
 -Develop mechanism for making hindcasts and assigning an appropriate date for when they "would" have been done
 -Check that all parts of the system sufficiently exclude an election from impacting its own forecast (for hindcasts)
 -Overhaul mechanisms to count WA Nats as a separate party while maintaining TPP dynamics
 -Create hindcasts for earlier parts of 2022fed and maybe 2022sa
 -Create hindcasts for earlier elections
 
Workflow:
 -run trend models with --bias, --calibrate
 -run pollster analyses (must wait for all trend models with overlapping time to do --bias and --calibrate)
 -run "pure" analyses (pollster analysis for this election (only) must be complete)
 -run full analyses (pure analysis for all previous and overlapping times must be complete)
 -run analyses w/cutoffs (can be done as soon as previous/overlapping pure trends are done)
 -run trend adjustment (need cutoffs up to and including this election to be complete)
