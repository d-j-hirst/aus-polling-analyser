Polling Analyser to-do:
-Take historical polling analysis from its current cumbersome spreadsheet to a fast, automatic program
 -LNP best prior: 6 previous elections (7.567)
 -ALP best prior: 5 previous election (7.696)

 -Add config option to have analysis for a given "excluded" election, which will exclude its data from any inputs. Also an option to do all elections in one batch, or excluded none (which would be used for actual forecasts)
 -Process this option and loop through all excluded elections in the batch, running the rest of the program as before but excising data for the excluded election
 -Change the output of coefficients from the current reporting for all elections, to only the complete set under the name of the election that is excluded
 -Change output of errors to be the one currently seen in record_errors_by_day, the current output in calculate_parameter_curves and calculations leading to it may be deleted. Again, this should be output under the name of the excluded election
 -Adjust main program to use the new analysis
-Add function to automatically load polls from trend output into the file
-More sophisticated handling of non-classic and potentially non-classic seats
-(Make any further adjustments to existing analysis processes)
-Create simple backend w/ authorisation that takes election forecast from an authorised user and sends a formatted version to a frontend on request
-Setup basic framework for frontend, including getting some data from the backend and displaying it
-Work step by step to add more data flow from the authorised user and displaying it
-Develop documentation detailing the forecasting methodology
-Publish on a public-facing webpage

-Configure model # of simulations by user
-Advanced simulations!
 -Start by organising past election data
  -Need to load conversions between equivalent seats
  -Then organise the existing election
